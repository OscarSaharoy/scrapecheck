Support independent journalism

ProPublica has a singular mission: to produce deep-dive, well-researched, nonpartisan journalism that holds power accountable and spurs real-world change. And we deliver results. Over the years, our reporting has resulted in new laws being passed, innocent people freed from prison and people in power resigning.


As a nonprofit newsroom, we rely on donations from individuals like you to fuel our work. Your support today will directly fund investigations that shine a light on urgent issues: corporations prioritizing profits over public safety, health insurers denying coverage to patients, unintended consequences of new laws and so much more.


Join over 80,000 members committed to supporting truth and accountability. Make a gift of any amount today. Thank you!
