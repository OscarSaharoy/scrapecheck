Taylor Swift relishes announcing her albums in dramatic fashion. On Tuesday, she did it again, revealing the name of her 12th original studio album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” when a countdown clock on her website ticked down to 12:12 a.m. Eastern.

She did not disclose the release date of the album, or any other information about its tracks.

Known for meticulously placing Easter eggs ahead of announcements, Swift’s team set off speculation from her hyperattentive fan base by posting a carousel of photos on Instagram on Monday. Could the 12 photos, taken at stops on the Eras Tour, correspond with the singer-songwriter’s 12th studio album? Did the pattern of orange outfits align with Swift’s practice of color-coding her catalog?
