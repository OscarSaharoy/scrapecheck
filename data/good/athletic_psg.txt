Gianluigi Donnarumma won the Champions League last season, reached the Club World Cup final with Paris Saint-Germain ‚Äî and yet, he finds himself potentially on the way out of the Parc des Princes.

As The Athletic‚Äôs James Horncastle and Mario Cortegana reported in The Transfer DealSheet on Monday, he is expected to leave PSG. The 26-year-old goalkeeper released a statement on Tuesday evening expressing his frustration: ‚ÄúUnfortunately, someone has decided that I can no longer be part of the group and contribute to the team‚Äôs success. I am disappointed and disheartened.‚Äù

PSG signed goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier this summer, and people familiar with the matter at the club seem accepting of the idea of losing Donnarumma. They say they offered the goalkeeper a new contract on improved terms, but this was turned down.

His representative Enzo Raiola then told Sky Italia on Tuesday night: ‚ÄúWe accepted an offer below the current salary because Gigio wanted to stay, then they changed the tables, at which point we broke off negotiations and agreed to get in touch again after the Champions League final. We got in touch before the Club World Cup and they confirmed their willingness to continue. We did not expect what then happened in the last 10 days.

‚ÄúI understand the need to buy a new goalkeeper, but to take Gigio out after all he has done for the club is a huge lack of respect that I will assess with my lawyers. Until a month ago we were talking about renewing, it‚Äôs strange that in a month the coach changed his mind about Gigio as a player.‚Äù

That coach is Luis Enrique and speaking before the UEFA Super Cup final against Tottenham tonight, he said he had the full backing of the club and explained his reasoning: ‚ÄúIt is a difficult decision. I only have praise for Donnarumma. He is one of the very best goalkeepers out there and an even better man. But we were looking for a different profile. It‚Äôs very difficult to take these types of decisions.‚Äù

But what is the profile PSG and Luis Enrique are looking for? Why doesn‚Äôt Donnarumma have it? And what do his limitations mean for potential suitors? Here, The Athletic‚Äôs goalkeeping expert Matt Pyzdrowski takes a look.

When Donnarumma arrived in Paris in 2021, he was just 22 but already a European Championship winner with Italy, a veteran of over 250 senior appearances for Milan, and widely regarded as one of the world‚Äôs premier young goalkeepers. That reputation was built on years of consistent elite shot-stopping, the kind of ability that, last season, he showcased on the biggest stage once again. His Champions League performances, particularly in the semi-final against Arsenal, served as a timely reminder of exactly why he was so coveted.

Over two legs, Donnarumma was magnificent, first standing tall in a one-v-one against Leandro Trossard in the first leg, then springing down to his left through a crowded penalty area to claw away Martin Odegaard‚Äôs strike in the second leg. Both saves were the kind of high-difficulty, high-value moments that define seasons, and they underlined his reputation as one of the best pure goalkeepers in the world when it comes to keeping the ball out of the net.

And yet, as the summer transfer window closes, PSG have chosen to move in a different direction. In Chevalier, signed from Lille, they believe they have found a goalkeeper who better suits where they want to go, even if that means parting with one of the game‚Äôs best shot-stoppers. The decision isn‚Äôt about Donnarumma‚Äôs ability to save shots. It‚Äôs about fit.
Top Stories

Luis Enrique‚Äôs PSG have made no secret of their ambition to dominate possession and control matches through structured build-up play. Statistically, they already lead Ligue 1 in that department, averaging 68.4 per cent possession last season. But within that number lies a subtle tactical compromise: with Donnarumma in goal, PSG often played longer than they ideally wanted to, bypassing the first phase of build-up because their goalkeeper wasn‚Äôt as comfortable under pressure.

Donnarumma is a fine passer in safe situations, capable of moving the ball to a centre-back or full-back without fuss, but he is not naturally inclined to step high, invite the press, and split lines with disguised passes. Under Luis Enrique, that is a problem. When the goalkeeper is reluctant to be the extra outfield player in possession, the team either slows down or is forced into less controlled territory. Chevalier‚Äôs arrival signals PSG‚Äôs determination to remove that limitation.

For Lille, Chevalier was a true 11th outfield player in the build-up, often stepping outside his box to create a back three. He wasn‚Äôt just participating either; he was central to their offensive structure. His willingness to take the ball under pressure, change angles with one or two touches, and then pick the right moment to break the press aligns perfectly with Luis Enrique‚Äôs vision. Chevalier‚Äôs passing profile is varied, too. He will play short to his centre-backs, but he is equally adept at skipping lines into midfield or hitting driven passes to full-backs in advanced positions. His super-strength, though, is his long, flat distribution over a high line, a weapon that will allow PSG to both relieve pressure and maintain possession higher up the pitch. In short, he offers solutions that Donnarumma does not.

It isn‚Äôt just in possession where the two differ. Despite standing at 6ft 5in (196cm), Donnarumma has never been the most proactive goalkeeper in dealing with aerial deliveries. He tends to stay on his line and let his defenders contest balls in the air, even when his frame might suggest he could dominate that space. That isn‚Äôt to say he is incapable of claiming crosses (he certainly can), but it is not a natural instinct. It is very much an area he can still look to improve.

Chevalier, at 6ft 2in (188cm), lacks Donnarumma‚Äôs height but compensates with aggression and timing. He is quick to come off his line for high balls, confident in traffic, and particularly alert to cutbacks ‚Äî an increasingly common danger in the modern game. This decisiveness allows his defenders to hold a higher line with greater confidence, knowing their goalkeeper will cover the space behind them.

Replacing Donnarumma inevitably means replacing one of the best shot-stoppers in the game. His reach, reflexes, and ability to read the shooter in one-on-one situations make him elite in denying clear scoring chances. PSG‚Äôs success in last season‚Äôs Champions League owes much to his interventions. Chevalier, however, is no weak link in this area. While not as physically imposing, his lean frame and long limbs give him exceptional reach, and his ability to set early and react sharply means he covers the corners with minimal steps. His save numbers at Lille were impressive, not just because of the volume, but because of the quality of chances he kept out.

The point for PSG is not that Chevalier will necessarily stop more shots than Donnarumma. It‚Äôs that he can combine high-level shot-stopping with the proactive, possession-oriented attributes they now prioritise. In elite football, the smallest margins can drive big decisions. Donnarumma is still an outstanding goalkeeper, but for PSG, the ceiling of their tactical identity is higher with Chevalier. The statistics ‚Äî more passes, more involvement in build-up, better aerial aggression ‚Äî reinforce what the eye test shows.

There‚Äôs also an element of timing. PSG see themselves at the beginning of a tactical cycle under Luis Enrique, not in the middle of one. That makes this the moment to commit to a goalkeeper who can grow with that style. Chevalier, at 23, has room to develop further, and PSG believe he has the temperament to handle the pressure of playing for one of Europe‚Äôs biggest clubs.

Donnarumma‚Äôs future will be fascinating. The Italian‚Äôs skill set ‚Äî elite shot-stopping, calm in big moments, vast experience despite his age ‚Äî would suit a host of top clubs. But the stylistic fit will matter. He thrives when the build-up demands on him are simplified and when he can focus on doing what he does best: keeping the ball out of the net.

Despite speculation earlier this week, The Athletic‚Äôs Laurie Whitwell clarified in The Transfer DealSheet that Manchester United are not pursuing him. But that doesn‚Äôt mean suitors won‚Äôt emerge, especially from clubs that value defensive solidity above possession dominance. In the right environment, Donnarumma can still be a difference-maker at the highest level. After all, he is a Champions League winner, a European Championship winner, and still only 26.

‚ÄúMaybe only teams in the Premier League can meet the club‚Äôs financial demands, which are over the top,‚Äù claimed Raiola on Tuesday when discussing the player‚Äôs future. ‚ÄúThey talk about respect but at this point maybe the respect is only financial. It is not a matter of getting out of a project and finding what‚Äôs best for Gigio. Even from how it looks, we have to take a stance and figure out how to deal with the club.‚Äù

In the end, PSG‚Äôs decision is not an indictment of Donnarumma‚Äôs ability, but an example of how elite teams now define the goalkeeper position. The role has evolved beyond shot-stopping into something more multi-dimensional ‚Äî part sweeper, part playmaker, part aerial enforcer. Chevalier represents that vision. He is comfortable 30 yards from his goal in possession, confident in splitting a press with a single pass, and aggressive in claiming balls before they become dangerous. In the modern game, those qualities can be as decisive as a fingertip save.

For PSG, this is about alignment. With Chevalier, they believe they can further refine their possession play, keep the ball higher up the pitch for longer, and dominate games even more than their already eye-watering possession numbers suggest. With Donnarumma, they had one of the best traditional goalkeepers in the world; with Chevalier, they believe they have the modern profile that will take them where they want to go.

The difference might be subtle, but for a club aiming to win every competition they enter, the goalkeeper isn‚Äôt just the last line of defence, he‚Äôs the first line of attack.
