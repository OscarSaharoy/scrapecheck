What is ‘Smackdown!’ about?

“WWE SmackDown!” is a weekly professional wrestling television show produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It first aired in 1999 and has become one of WWE’s flagship programs alongside “Monday Night Raw”. The show features scripted storylines, dramatic rivalries, and athletic matches between WWE Superstars. SmackDown showcases both rising talent and established stars, often including championship bouts and major plot developments that shape WWE’s larger universe. With a mix of action, entertainment, and spectacle, it appeals to a global audience and regularly tours major arenas across the U.S. and abroad. SmackDown currently airs on Friday nights and continues to be a cornerstone of WWE programming.
What happened last week at SmackDown?

Friday night’s WWE SmackDown (August 8, 2025) was packed with emotion, action, and big moments, live from Montreal’s Bell Centre. The legendary John Cena kicked things off to a thunderous reception, addressing Brock Lesnar’s shocking SummerSlam return and promising he’s not backing down from any challenge. His heartfelt promo even reunited him backstage with R-Truth, who humorously acknowledged Cena’s recent heel-to-babyface flip.

In the ring, MFT’s Talla Tonga and JC Mateo snagged a win over the Motor City Machine Guns, only for Solo Sikoa to hype himself as unbeatable before suddenly facing hometown hero Sami Zayn, who rolled up the U.S. Champion in a surprise non-title victory.

The women’s scene delivered fun, too: Charlotte Flair crashed Alexa Bliss’ birthday celebration and made quick work of Chelsea Green, frosting and all.

The night wrapped with Cody Rhodes and Cena teaming up against Drew McIntyre and Logan Paul. A low blow on Cena led to disqualification, and then things went sideways. McIntyre battered Rhodes with a belt and Claymore’d him through the announcer’s table in a brutal closing angle, leaving the champ in peril.
